# InfiniteNews
This is a demo application that showcases the ability to fetch data from a backend to update its contents as the user scrolls down, making it seem like it is an infinite scroller.

The project is entirely done using apple's newest UI framework "SwiftUI"

The api used to fetch the data is the newsapi: https://newsapi.org
